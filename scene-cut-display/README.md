# Scene Cut Display

Different ways to visualize and display edit pace, scene cuts, etc.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## `paperjs/`

An attempt with `paper.js`, which seems like an outdated drawing library

## Scene Image Display
