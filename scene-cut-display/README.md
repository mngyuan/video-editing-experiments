# Scene Cut Display

Different ways to visualize and display edit pace, scene cuts, etc.

`pip install scenedetect[opencv] --pre --upgrade`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scene Image Display

Displays every image from _Drive My Car_

`python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory editdb/films/`

## `paperjs/`

An attempt with `paper.js`, which seems like an outdated drawing library

## Further Work

- One frame per minute
- 100 even cuts
- Fix scene transition detection
- remove large binary files from repo
